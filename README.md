In the high-stakes environment of customer service call centers, the precision and relevance of agent responses are paramount to maintaining high customer satisfaction levels. We explore the implementation of a novel methodology inspired by the popular video game "Guitar Hero," aiming to scrutinize and enhance the effectiveness of Language and Linguistics Models (LLMs) in responding to customer requests. Utilizing synthetic transcripts of agent-customer interactions, the study employs ChatGPT 3.5 to generate responses, which are subsequently embedded into vector representations using the text-embedding-ada-002 OpenAI embedding model. These vectors are then juxtaposed against actual agent responses through calculating their cosine similarity, serving as a metric to evaluate and ultimately bolster the model's proficiency in yielding apt and efficient responses. We delve into the methodological intricacies, computational logistics, and preliminary findings of employing this innovative approach in the real-time analysis and enhancement of automated customer service interactions.
